		<h1>Commu-ters Manifesto</h1>

		<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, we are delayed because of train traffic ahead. We should be moving shortly, we apologize for the inconvenience.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>1. Our true heroes are stuck in a tube. The rush hour nation is held captive by the whims of the villainous MTA.</li>
			<li>The transit workers union is divided, between those sympathetic to the plight of the subway nation and the treacherous servants of nation of swine.</li>
			<li>FTP (fuck the police)</li>
			<li>ACAB (all cops are bastards) </li>
			<li>The subway nationâ€™s demands:
				<ol>
					<li>Truly free and public transit.</li>
					<li>Complete accessibility of every station and bus for all riders.</li>
					<li>A subway or bus station within every .5 miles of a residential area.</li>
					<li>A strict ban on all capitalist imagery on the trains to be replaced with art by the people.</li>
					<li>Swine banned from the train. </li>
					<li>Anyone perpetuating oppression including but not limited to sexual harassers and assaulters, racists etc are to be seized from the train and dealt with swiftly with hot soup thrown on their faces. Excess soup to be distributed to whoever.</li>
					<li>Official support for subway performers. </li>
					<li>Comprehensive upgrades to train and bus services to be paid for by the wealth seized from the rich.</li>
					<li>A ruthless and thorough campaign against the presence of rats in the subways for their relocation to houses of swine.</li>
				</ol>
			<li>The transitory nation disdains to conceal its view and aims. We openly declare that our end can only be attained by the forcible overthrow of the MTA, NYPD, and the US government. Let the ruling class tremble at a rush hour revolution. The commuters have nothing to lose but the straps they hang from. They have the ability to actually arrive the FUCK on time for once to win. Commuters of all bus and subway lines, unite!</li>
		</ol>
